//! Shared boundary contract between [`crate::daemon`] and [`crate::refresh_tick`].
//!
//! These types are the seam the two modules speak across: the time [`Clock`] and the
//! periodic-refresh [`RefreshTicker`] the daemon's run loop drives, plus the per-sweep data
//! ([`SweepOutcome`], [`RefreshObservation`], [`RefreshDelta`]) the ticker hands back. Housing
//! them here — rather than inside `daemon` — lets `refresh_tick` depend on the contract WITHOUT
//! depending on the whole daemon, untangling the `daemon ↔ refresh_tick` dependency cycle
//! (issue #202; the enabling step for the #195 per-concern decomposition). The module depends
//! only on [`crate::observability`] and `std` / `tokio`, never on `daemon` or `refresh_tick`, so
//! it is a leaf both build on. `daemon` re-exports these under `crate::daemon::*` for its own
//! callers, so relocating them is source-compatible for every existing consumer.
