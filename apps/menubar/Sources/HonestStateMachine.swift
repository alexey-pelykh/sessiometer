// The pure, synchronous decision core of the menu-bar status store (issue #324): the "honest-state
// machine" (D2). It folds the transport's `AsyncStream<TransportEvent>` (#323) plus the wire decoder
// (#322) into the single view state the UI renders — a `ConnectionState`, the `[AccountRow]` roster,
// `nextSwap` / `refreshEnabled` / `generatedAt`, and a `PresentationState` (glyph + a11y label) for
// the status item.
//
// It is the UI-side analogue of the daemon's no-torn-swap / no-false-healthy discipline (ADR-0003):
// the crown-jewel invariant is **never render healthy on a degraded or absent daemon** (anti-#137,
// `design-menubar.md` D-UX-state). That invariant is enforced STRUCTURALLY here, not by convention:
// `ConnectionState` is a PURE function of two internal axes —
//
//   * `liveness`      — is the connection currently delivering VALID data? (from transport events)
//   * `snapshotClass` — what did the last decoded snapshot say? (none / healthy / empty / unsupported)
//
// and the healthy verdict (`.connected`, the only healthy glyph) is reachable on EXACTLY ONE
// combination: `liveness == .live` AND `snapshotClass == .healthy`. Every degraded or absent path
// (initial, awaiting-first-snapshot, stale, disconnected, empty, unsupported) resolves to a
// non-healthy state by construction — there is no assignment that sets "healthy" from a drop, a
// silence, an undecodable line, or a bare reconnect.
//
// Functional-core / imperative-shell, mirroring `WatchStateMachine` + `WatchTransport`: ALL the
// honest-state logic lives here as a value type with no I/O, no clock, and no concurrency, so every
// transition is exhaustively unit-testable synchronously. `WatchStatusStore` is the thin `@MainActor`
// `ObservableObject` shell that pumps this machine from the injected event stream and mirrors its
// derived state into `@Published` properties + the presentation stream.
//
// SCOPE: the #324 MINIMAL honest-state baseline — connecting / connected / empty-roster / stale /
// disconnected / unsupported — PLUS the #169 crash-loop healthy-flash debounce (the crown-jewel
// anti-#137 mitigation: a crash-looping daemon is held in `.crashLooping`, never flickered healthy)
// PLUS the #499 not-running / daemon-starting split: a COLD connect-refused (no live connection EVER
// held this session — discriminated by `hasEverConnected`, NOT by transport enrichment) reads as the
// transient `.starting` within a short start grace, then escalates to the durable `.notRunning` once
// the grace elapses still refused. The WARM drop gets the SAME grace-then-escalate discipline (#526,
// the mirror of the cold split): a live connection held then lost reads as the transient `.reconnecting`
// within a bounded warm-dwell window (so a routine daemon restart / wake-from-sleep socket blip rides the
// calm `…` self-resolving glance), then escalates to the durable `.disconnected` once the dwell elapses
// still dropped (the loud `!`, for a genuinely-dead daemon). The dwell timer SUSPENDS across system sleep
// (`systemWillSleep` / `systemDidWake`) so a lid-closed-overnight disconnect never opens on a false
// Attention. The REMAINING degraded-state-map facets are tracked siblings, NOT this file: the
// rich version-skew upgrade UX, plus the daemon-level PAYLOAD faults that ride alongside a `.connected`
// roster — of which the two "act now" ones (keychain-locked, canonical-scrub-`exhausted`) now project
// to the `.noRunway` glyph via `PresentationState.make` (issue #520); relogin, scrub-`recovering`, and
// `systemic_refresh_failure` (#523) stay unmapped on the glyph.
//
// STORE-SIDE STALENESS WATCHDOG (#344): staleness must NOT depend solely on the transport's
// byte-level liveness timer. The transport re-arms that timer on ANY non-empty line — garbage,
// `{"error":…}`, unknown frames included — so a daemon holding the connection open while streaming
// only UNDECODABLE frames (spaced < the transport's window) after one healthy snapshot would keep
// the transport perpetually live → it never emits `.stale` → the last healthy snapshot is retained
// → the menubar renders healthy on a garbage-emitting daemon. This machine therefore runs its OWN
// generation-guarded watchdog keyed on VALID DECODABLE FRAMES (a `snapshot` or `heartbeat`), NOT raw
// bytes: `watchdogElapsed(generation:)` downgrades a live connection to `.stale` once the window has
// passed with no valid frame. It is an ADDITIONAL, independent path to `.stale` that fires even while
// the transport still thinks the connection is live; the transport's own `.stale` continues to work
// unchanged. The pure core stays clock-free (mirroring `WatchStateMachine`) — the `WatchStatusStore`
// shell performs the real `Task.sleep(for:)` and feeds the elapse back.
