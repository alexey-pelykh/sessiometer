// The provider-neutral status-item gauge (issue #325): the SHAPE-encoded template `NSImage` SET the
// menu-bar `NSStatusItem` renders — one image per `StatusGlyph`. Split out as a PURE, self-contained
// factory (no `NSStatusItem`, no store, no timing) so the whole shape-per-state contract is unit-
// testable headless — the functional-core split `HonestStateMachine` is to `WatchStatusStore`.
//
// WHY SHAPE, NOT COLOR (the load-bearing constraint): a menu-bar image is a TEMPLATE image — macOS
// re-tints it to match the bar (dark glyph on a light bar, light glyph on a dark bar, accented while
// the menu is open). A template is therefore MONOCHROME by definition, so COLOR cannot carry health —
// the SHAPE must. Every glyph here is a DISTINCT silhouette (`design-menubar`: "SF Symbol template
// image — shape, not color"). Because the images are `isTemplate = true`, they tint correctly in
// light AND dark menu bars for free.
//
// BESPOKE artwork (issue #437): the four shapes are now the Sessiometer "Cycle Gauge" mark redrawn at
// bar size — a custom SF Symbol `.symbolset` per state, NOT a generic system symbol (and NOT any
// provider's mark: our own gauge, satisfying #173). Each glyph is a SHARED CHASSIS (the open gauge arc +
// rotation arrowhead from `brand/src/icon.svg`, untransformed; the thin needle + pivot dot are DROPPED —
// they vanish at 16 pt) plus ONE bold interior mark that carries the state: a low check `✓` (healthy), a
// three-dot ellipsis `…` (connecting), an exclamation `!` (attention), a slash `⊘` (no-runway). The
// symbolsets are authored + emitted by `brand/generate.sh` (the asset SSOT — never hand-edit the
// generated files) into `Assets.xcassets`, and loaded here by name via `NSImage(named:)`.
//
// KNOWN + ACCEPTED (issue #437): because the chassis is shared, the four glyphs differ only in the small
// interior mark, so they are close in silhouette at bar size — the shared chassis owns most of the ink.
// Whether that is legible enough is an ON-DEVICE, real-`NSStatusItem` question (light + dark, Increase
// Contrast, over a bright wallpaper, beside system icons) that a raster proxy cannot settle; #437's
// PRIORITY-1 falsifier is exactly that on-device shape-distinctness check. This file ships the faithful
// locked artwork; the definitive distinctness verdict is captured separately (see the debug glyph gallery
// in `main.swift`, `SESSIOMETER_GLYPH_GALLERY`).
