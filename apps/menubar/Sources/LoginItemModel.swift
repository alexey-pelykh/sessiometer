// The launch-at-login model (issue #170): the pure `@MainActor` decision layer over `SMAppService` login-item
// + LaunchAgent registration, exposing the "Launch at login" toggle intent and the "Start daemon" affordance
// to the Settings form and the not-running panel card. It is the login-item SIBLING of `SettingsModel` (#268)
// and `AccountSwapModel` (#169) — the same tested-shell / untested-OS-wrapper split, only the surface differs.
//
// AppKit- AND ServiceManagement-FREE by design (Foundation + Combine + os only) so it compiles into the
// headless `MenubarTests` bundle and its toggle derivation, idempotent first-launch registration,
// `.requiresApproval` handling, the two-owner guard, and the Start-daemon phase machine are all driven
// hermetically against a fake `LoginItemService` — NO real `SMAppService` registration, no login item ever
// written to the operator's account by a test run. The concrete `SMAppServiceLoginItemService` (which imports
// `ServiceManagement` and touches the OS) stays in the app target, the same split `SettingsModel` (tested) vs
// `SettingsView`/`SMAppServiceLoginItem` (app-only) uses.
//
// NO credential handling of any kind (C-001 / issue #15): the whole surface is registration state (login item
// + LaunchAgent), which carries no token, email, or oauth blob. A `.failed` reason is a redacted registration
// message, never a secret.
//
// TWO-OWNER INVARIANT (issue #170 / #329, load-bearing): the `org.sessiometer.agent` LaunchAgent can be
// registered by the Rust CLI (`sessiometer service install`, `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, `src/service.rs`) AND
// by this app (a bundled `SMAppService.agent` plist) — ONE identity, deliberately shared. Two plists on one
// label collide. The app is the newcomer, so it YIELDS: when the CLI already owns the label
// (`cliManagedAgentPresent`), the app never registers its bundled agent and the Start affordance stands down.
