// The in-app "Capture active account" affordance's model (issue #360): the thin `@MainActor` shell that
// owns the ONE-SHOT capture exchange over the #358 control-command transport and exposes its
// idle → pending → done → failed phase to the SwiftUI panel. It is the capture SIBLING of the read-only
// `WatchStatusStore` (#324): the store PROJECTS the daemon's `watch` stream; this model SENDS one write
// command and renders its redacted ack — it never touches the roster. The captured row arrives on its own
// via the `watch` snapshot (command → daemon → `watch` → UI); the affordance never inserts a row itself
// (issue #360 AC), and on success it just returns to idle.
//
// AppKit-free BY DESIGN (Foundation + Combine + os only) so it compiles into the headless `MenubarTests`
// bundle and its phase transitions are driven hermetically against a fake connector — no socket, no live
// daemon (the same testability split the store uses). The panel-key re-assertion — a non-activating
// `FloatingPanel` (hidesOnDeactivate=false) needs `makeKey` re-asserted when the label field takes focus,
// or the `TextField` cannot accept keystrokes — is injected as a plain closure (`panelKeyRequest`) so this
// model names no AppKit type; `StatusItemController` supplies `{ panel.makeKey() }`.
//
// NO credential handling of any kind (C-001 / issue #15): it serializes a verb + an optional non-secret
// label and receives a redacted ack — the whole channel carries no token, email, or oauth blob.
