# Menubar design reference

The canonical **visual** build-reference for the SwiftUI menubar panel (see #168 / #169).
`menubar-preview.html` is a single self-contained mock of **all 9 launch-or-attach states**
(light + dark) in the intended native macOS language.

![All 9 menubar states, light + dark](renders/all-states.png)

## Viewing it

- **Interactive / most faithful** — open the HTML in a browser: `open menubar-preview.html`
- **At a glance** — `renders/all-states.png` above, rendered from the HTML.

## Regenerating the render

The mock uses `backdrop-filter` vibrancy, which needs **GPU compositing**. Render with a
GPU-enabled headless Chrome — do **not** pass `--disable-gpu` (it forces software rendering and
blacks out the vibrancy). Run from this directory:

```sh
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
  --headless=new --hide-scrollbars --force-device-scale-factor=1.5 \
  --window-size=1200,7600 --screenshot=renders/all-states.png \
  menubar-preview.html
```

(Bump the `--window-size` height if the page ever grows past it.)

## It's a mock, not code

The mock approximates native treatments in HTML/CSS. When building the SwiftUI panel, translate
each to its native equivalent rather than copying the CSS literally:

| Mock (HTML/CSS)              | Native (SwiftUI / AppKit)                    |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `backdrop-filter` vibrancy   | `NSVisualEffectView` material                |
| hex colors                   | system semantic `Color` / `NSColor`          |
| tabular numerals             | `.monospacedDigit()`                          |
| health glyph (drawn SVG)     | SF Symbol **template** image (shape, not color) |

The hex values and pixel metrics are **directional**, not targets.

## The 9 states

Healthy (status + stats, both themes), daemon-starting, not-running, crash-looping,
disconnected (stale), stale-snapshot, keychain-locked, version-skew, empty-roster/first-run.
Each state is a **distinct icon shape + panel message + affordance**; the panel never renders
healthy on a degraded daemon.

## Design constraints the mock honors

- **Identity** — each row leads with the account's operator-chosen **label** (never the email;
  defaults to the account UUID when unset), provider on a quieter secondary line.
- **Provider-neutral** — a monochrome monogram badge + plain-text label, no brand color or logo.
- **Copy-command, never a runner** — `capture` / `brew upgrade` buttons copy the command to the
  clipboard; the app never runs them, and there is **no fake spinner** (daemon-starting shows a
  static "forming" glyph).
- **Honest state** — disconnected rows are dimmed + "stale", never frozen-as-live.
